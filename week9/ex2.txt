We must frequently refer to the already referred pages that are in page frames to increase hits.
For example, we have 15 frames and we get 1 page per tick. Then to maximize hits we can construct this sequence of references:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ...

We must often refer to pages that are not in frames because we are referring to a page that was previously removed from the page frames.
The same example. We have 15 frames and we get 1 page per tick. Then to minimize hits we can construct this sequence of references:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ...
