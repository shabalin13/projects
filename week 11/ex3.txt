Program 1 prints "Hello" 2 times
Program 2 prints "Hello" 1 time

UNIX terminals uses line buffering by default

Program 1:

We have "Hello" string
fork() calls child and parent processes, each of which has the string "Hello" in its buffers
For each buffer of the child and parent processes, after "\n" the text is printed and the buffer is emptied => "Hello" is printed twice.

Program 2:

We have "Hello\n" string
After "/n" buffer is emptied
fork() calls child and parent processes, each containing an empty buffer => "Hello" is printed once
